# Network

## Almofire vs. URLSession

### Almofire

- Easy to implement features
  - Syntax are a lot easier to use, easier error handling
- Updates of Almofire may cause crashes



## TCP/IP

- Application -> Transport -> Internet -> Network Access
- Application
  - Interface with end users
  - Data is formatted, converted, encrypted/decrypted, sent to users
  - Open/Close, manage a session between end user process
- Transport (TCP)
  - Services the application with different ports
  - Reliable end-toend data transport and data stream services (TCP for reliable, UDP for unreliable)
- Internet
  - Providing host addressing
  - Choose the best path to the destinatio network(Routing)
- Network Access
  - Two sublayers:
    - Logical Link Control: provides services to the upper layers
    - Media Access Control: defines how devices access the medium, Token Passing Host addressing(MAC addressing)

## OSI

- Application -> Presentation -> Session -> Transport -> Network -> Data Link -> Physical
